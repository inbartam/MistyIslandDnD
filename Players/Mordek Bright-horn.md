# Desert Discovery

The temple was a marvel to behold.

A goliath of granite, it's huge stones worn down over the years by sandstorms, it towered over the surrounding flat, beige desert for what appeared to be millennia.

Mordek was excited for what he would find there - after all, he was an excellent thief, and he loved nothing more than venturing into temples and houses and offices to find the delicious treasures within.

As Mordek steps closer, dozens of stone columns reached high for a now-gone roof leading to the entrance.

As he stepped into the grand square hole in the temple, which probably once housed a grand door guarded by some grand guards, Mordek could not help but think to himself what an easy job this was.

Usually there was a lock to pick, security to evade, maybe even a guard to kill should one stand in his way.

But this temple is empty.

Surely there is nothing left here to steal and that man from the Hammers lied to him?

If so, he would find him and punish him for sending Mordek all the way to this vast, empty wasteland.

Mordek didn't usually take pleasure in killing, but this time there would be good reason to.

It was an odd job, though. Why hire him to steal something unguarded? what was the play here?

After all, if a treasure is left all this time untouched, maybe that was a sign it should stay that way.

Mordek banished the thought out of his mind.

There was a job to do. ## Job first guy?

He steps gingerly inside the entrance, eagerly awaiting a trap he could spring and avoid.

No such luck. # pasimist?

Whoever built this temple really wasn't worried about thieves.

The entrance hall must have been once quite impressive, as it boasted a high ceiling, and many crumbling piles stood where columns decorated the space.

Stepping over some granite rubble, Mordek spots it - the entrance to the actual space the man described.

A large archway carved into the stone, inscribed with odd complicated runes lead to another smaller space.

And there it was.

Mordek had never seen anything so beautiful and ominous.

A dagger, long and sharp, it's hilt covered with the same runes on the archway.

It's blade shone with a curious red light.

It beckoned to him, half invitation half command.

Mordek stepped towards it with caution.

Carefully examining the blade, he inched his hand towards the hilt.

The closer his hand came to the hilt the stronger that strange pull in his mind that seemed to shout 'DEATH! FIRE! DESTRUCTION! BURN IT ALL!'.

Mordek grasps the hilt.

A searing, blinding pain grips him and for a moment he is no longer in the temple, no longer in the desert, no longer in Rumpfort.

He sees her then. A teifling woman laying on her knees, crying red tears, surrounded by ashes. Flames. Destruction. Suffering.

When Mordek awakes, he is lying on the temple floor.

In his hands, the blade seems to have sprung black tendrils up his arm.

He tries to throw it from him, but it will not stray from his palm.

Then she speaks.
