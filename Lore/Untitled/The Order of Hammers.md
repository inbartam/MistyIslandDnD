#### Structure of the Order

- **High Justicar**: The leader of the order, considered the living embodiment of [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul's]] will. The High Justicar directs the order’s missions, deciding where the need for justice is most pressing. They are chosen through a sacred trial, where the potential candidate must demonstrate perfect fairness and unyielding commitment to [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul's]] ideals.
    
- **Judicators**: Veteran members of the Order, the Judicators are responsible for leading missions and enforcing [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul's]] law. Each Judicator commands a squad of Templars, guiding them in hunting down those who disrupt the order of the world. They are also the primary judges in trials, where they deliver divine justice to wrongdoers.
    
- **Templars**: The knights of the Order of the Hammer. They are skilled warriors trained in combat, diplomacy, and law. Templars are sent on missions to track down criminals, heretics, and those who violate the principles of justice. They often act as arbiters in small disputes but are ruthless when dealing with those who seek to undermine the law.
    
- **Seekers of Truth**: These are the investigative branch of the Order, tasked with uncovering corruption, hidden evils, and those who manipulate the law for their own gain. The Seekers are masters of stealth, interrogation, and investigation, ensuring that no injustice remains hidden. They gather evidence before passing judgment to the Judicators.
    

#### The Oath of Justice

All members of the Order take the **Oath of Justice**, a solemn vow to uphold [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul's]] laws at any cost. This oath binds them to a life of service, where personal desires are set aside in favor of the greater good. Their primary creed is simple: _"By hammer and shield, we stand against chaos. By Borul’s law, we deliver justice. We are the balance in a world of disorder."_

#### The Hammer’s Path

The templars follow a strict code of conduct known as the **Hammer’s Path**, which dictates that they must act with fairness, honor, and impartiality. They are forbidden from accepting bribes or allowing personal emotions to cloud their judgment. The penalty for breaking this code is exile or, in extreme cases, execution by their peers.

#### Their Hunt for Evil

The Order of the Hammer is known across the land for its relentless pursuit of those who disrupt the balance of law. They seek out:

- **Corrupt Leaders**: Whether mortal kings or corrupt priests, those who twist justice for personal gain become prime targets for the Order.
- **Heretics and Lawbreakers**: The Order hunts down those who violate sacred laws or disrupt the divine order, ensuring that they are brought to justice.
- **Rogue Mages and Warlords**: Those who use magic or military power to impose chaos and tyranny upon the world are dealt with swiftly, with templars delivering judgment without hesitation.

#### Temples and Trials

The temples of [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul]], maintained by the Order, act as both sacred sites and courts. These grand structures often feature towering statues of [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul]] wielding his hammer and shield. Within their halls, justice is administered, and trials are held. Both mortals and gods are said to respect the judgment of these temples, as the Order is seen as impartial and fair.

- **Divine Trials**: In the rare event of major disputes between powerful factions or influential leaders, the Order of the Hammer holds **Divine Trials**. During these trials, evidence is presented before Judicators, and the final judgment is seen as [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul's]] divine will. Once a verdict is reached, it cannot be overturned by any authority, mortal or divine.

#### Weapons and Armor

Members of the Order are easily recognized by their silver and black armor, emblazoned with [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul's]] symbol of a hammer over a shield. Their primary weapon is the **Hammer of Justice**, a magically imbued warhammer that represents [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul's]] strength. They also carry shields that symbolize their role as defenders of order and law.

#### The Hunt and Punishment

When a lawbreaker is found guilty by the Order, they are often sentenced to a punishment befitting their crime:

- **Exile**: For those whose actions disrupt order but can be redeemed, exile to a distant land may be granted as a chance for redemption.
- **Execution**: For those who have committed grievous crimes, execution by the Hammer of Justice is swift and final. The templars believe that removing such corruption is necessary to restore balance.
- **Imprisonment in the Vault of Judgment**: The most dangerous offenders are locked away in the **Vault of Judgment**, a holy prison maintained by the Order, where the guilty spend eternity in contemplation of their crimes.

The **Order of the Hammer** is a beacon of justice in a world often dominated by chaos and corruption, a living manifestation of [[The Gods#**Borul – The Judge**|Borul]] unyielding will. They serve as both sword and shield, ensuring that the law is upheld, the wicked are punished, and the balance of the cosmos remains intact.
