Etheria is the largest and most influential of the [Island of mist](Islands.md), a land mass where humans have established an empire under the rule of **[Cassidian Dynasty](../Cassidian%20Dynasty.md)**. Divided into four regions - **Marstal Valley**, **Belt of Men**, **The Mining Hills**, and **The Three Rivers**. Etheria is the pinnacle of human ambition, while the remnants of other races are subjugated, exiled, or enslaved.
