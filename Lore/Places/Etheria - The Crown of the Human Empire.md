Etheria is the largest and most influential of the [Island of mist](Islands.md), a land mass where humans have established an empire under the rule of **[Cassidian Dynasty](../Cassidian%20Dynasty.md)**. Divided into four regions - **Marstal Valley**, **Belt of Men**, **The Stone Reach**, and **The Three Rivers**. Etheria is the pinnacle of human ambition, while the remnants of other races are subjugated, exiled, or enslaved.

### Three Rivers
A vast and treacherous region where three major rivers converge, forming an expansive swamp. This region is notorious for its treacherous terrain, with thick fog, shifting mud, and unpredictable currents making it nearly impossible to traverse without guidance. It serves as a natural boundary and a dumping ground for criminals and undesired non-humans, who are exiled here to survive amidst the harsh environment.
