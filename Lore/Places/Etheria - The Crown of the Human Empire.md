Etheria is the largest and most influential of the [Island of mist](Islands.md), a land mass where humans have established an empire under the rule of **[Cassidian Dynasty](../Cassidian%20Dynasty.md)**. Divided into four regions - **Marstal Valley**, **Belt of Men**, **The Stone Reach**, and **The Three Rivers**. Etheria is the pinnacle of human ambition, while the remnants of other races are subjugated, exiled, or enslaved.

## ***Society and Culture***
Etheria is predominantly populated by humans, with non-human races either exiled or enslaved. The regions have different rules regarding the presence of non-human.
 * In the Belt of Man non-humans are not allowed to live freely, and those who vvisit need special permission.
 * In Marstal Valley, non-humans serve as slaves, providing labor for noble families and contributing to the grandeur of the empire.
 * In Stone Reach, lizardfolks make up a significant part of the enslaved mining workforce, used for their natural endurance in the cold weather.
 * In the **Three Rivers**, non-humans such as goblins and kobolds are forced to work in the dangerous wetlands, extracting valuable resources that are used by alchemists and in the empire's market.
