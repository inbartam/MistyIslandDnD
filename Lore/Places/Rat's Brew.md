### **The Tavern**

- **Description**: The Shadowed Tankard is a rundown tavern in the heart of the Wildspear. Inside, rough-looking patrons sit at scarred wooden tables, nursing drinks under the dim glow of candlelight. The bartender is an older, grizzled dwarf with a cautious eye, watching everyone who enters.
    
- **Tavern Atmosphere**:
    
    - The air is thick with smoke, and the patrons eye newcomers with suspicion.
    - A faint hum of conversation is occasionally broken by arguments or loud laughter.
    - The barkeep, dour and reserved, seems to know everyone in the area but keeps his words short with strangers.

- **Encounter**:
    
    - **Information Gathering**: The adventurers can ask around about recent events, mysterious symbols, or strange sightings. The bartender might offer hints about the Overseer’s followers, mentioning “people who aren’t to be trifled with” gathering after dark.
    - **Tavern Patron**: A drunk patron in the corner rants about seeing a beast in the alleys, raving about “claws like iron” and “eyes that burn like holy light.”
