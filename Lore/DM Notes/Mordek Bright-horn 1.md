# Character Description

  

## Early Life

Tieflings were never loved much in the Anchor.

Their hellish appearance and leaning towards the chaotic and the strange instantly makes other people feel uncomfortable around them.

Following this prejudice, marrying a Tiefling was considered a great embarrassment to the family among the humans, dwarves, and elves on the isle.

Maybe that's why Mordek's Dad beat his mom so heavily.

Maybe it was shame, or the fact that being disowned from his family and estranged by his friends, that caused him such rage.

In any case, Mordek didn't remember much from his parents - when he was only five years old, after being beaten one too many times, Mordek's mother dismembered her husband in a rightous rage of retribution.

Mordek had never seen anything like it.

Pure carnal rage exploded on her terrible spouse, as she used her claws to shred him to pieces.

In a way, Mordek never recovered from that day.

He sure as hell can't forget it.

After eviscerating her husband, his mother got up from the butchered carcass with glassy, vacant eyes, passed Mordek to the front door, and went to the local enforcers to  report herself for her crime.

She was then promptly imprisoned, the house reclaimed by her husbands family, and since his mother had no family on the island, nor did his father's family want to claim him, Mordek was thrown to the streets.

And the streets in the Anchor were a tough, rotten place.

Food was scarce, and a good bed scarcer.

The streets were filthy from the constant traffic of merchants, guards and whores, and the smell of rotten meat emerged from butcher shops to enshroud the docks.

Mordek soon learned how to fight, how to beg, and most  importantly how to run from enforcers.

His bright red horns both hindered him when he was trying to go unseen and benefitted him when he tried to intimidate a bully.

The other kids on the streets soon started to call him 'Brighthorn'.

  

## Thieves Guild

Reaching the age of ten, Mordek Brighthorn was already a rough, gritty criminal.

That's when he met [[Alvyn Doublelock|Alvyn]].

A humbly dressed small gnome, he walked the street in a proud, self-confident way, that to Mordek screamed 'rob me! I'm so tiny and rich!'.

What a mistake.

Stumbling into Alvyn, Mordek slyly reached for the small gnome's purse, but all he found was empty space and an iron grip around his wrist.

'Hoo hoo! a good try as any, and for a boy so young! what a marvel you are, young man!'.

The gnomes eyes sparkled devilishly, as if he had sprung the world's most devious trap.

Mordek was shocked for as many reasons as their were islands in The Mist.

How did he catch him so fast? why didn't he sound mad, more like impressed? and most surprising of all, he didn't seem to have that all too familiar sneer he saw on everyone's face as they saw the large red horns and red markings on his face.

Did the gnome not notice that he was a Tiefling?.

He also must have seen the shock on Mordek's face, as he said 'My boy. You can probably rob half the island blind, but not me. And do not think for a moment your heritage has escaped me. I simply care more for what you can do than who your parents are. I'm **Alvyn Doublelock**, and if you'd care to join me, we could make a fine thief out of you.'

Alvyn was, as it turned out, a **Master Thief in the Thieves Guild**.

Alvyn quickly became Mordek's mentor and friend, and Mordek quickly became Alvyn's best student.

Learning fast and working hard, Mordek rises from Pickpocket to Shadowfoot in just a month shy of a decade.

Having Alvyn as a mentor was not easy, but Mordek learned how to sneak, steal, keep calm under pressure, expect traps, and most importantly put the job above all.

  

His last job certainly tested all of these tenants.

It was supposed to be quite simple: steal an enchanted ring from some merchant's house.

Piece of cake right?

Wrong.

This guy was nuts.

In every corner, a spring trap.

In every door, a wire trap.

In every room on every floor, dummy safes filled with garbage.

Is this guy for real?

Obviously Mordek avoided all of them.

As cleverly as they were installed, Mordek was an experienced thief after all, and while this thought crossed his mind, he spotted it - a heavy iron safe, peeking out from a crevice in a wall in the dark mansion.

He stepped towards it, not noticing the pressure plate in the entrance of the room.

Fuck.

A trap net sprung from the floor to encase him in rough rope, hung by a thread that lead to the ceiling.

Some thief he was! Alvyn would be ***so*** proud.

Mordek was trapped, for now.

A harsh, feminine voice emerged from the dark.

"Aha! I nobody is **that** good."

As he spins slowly, bundled up tight in his trap, reaching for his trusty dagger, he notices the person in front of him isn't the fat and jolly merchant he tailed earlier that day.

This was a judge, a Hammer, by the look of her official vest that peeked out from beneath her dark cowl. She was no merchant, that's for sure.

Curious. He expected to face some form of judge for this crime, just not this soon.

"You'll do well enough. I am [[The Hammer Tia|Thia]]. "

As she spoke, he saw a beautiful elven face emerge from the shadows of her cowl.

"What do you want from me, Elf?"

"Shut up and listen. This job was a ruse I set up to find me a worthy thief for the actual job. Listen closely..."

Leaving the merchant's house, Mordek felt electric.

Not only did he **not** spend the night in jail, he got what appeared to be an exciting new job!

The desert temple sounded like a fun job.

Mordek quite enjoyed the sneaking and stealing. Not so much the killing, though.

Don't be confused, Mordek would kill the occasional Guard or sentry when it was necessary, but he took no pleasure in it.

He refused to kill anyone that wasn't necessary for the success of a job.

This included children, the elderly, and a fish merchant called [[Nelly|Nelly]] that always seemed fond of him.

Every time his blade would sink into the heart of a victim, Mordek would think of his mother.

"Does this make me more like her? am I losing control?"

He never did. Always calm. Always cool. Always on the job.

  

## Desert Discovery

The temple was a marvel to behold.

  

A goliath of granite, it's huge stones worn down over the years by sandstorms, it towered over the surrounding flat, beige desert for what appeared to be millennia.

Mordek was excited for what he would find there - after all, he was an excellent thief, and he loved nothing more than venturing into temples and houses and offices to find the delicious treasures within.

As Mordek steps closer, dozens of stone columns reached high for a now-gone roof leading to the entrance.

As he stepped into the grand square hole in the temple, which probably once housed a grand door guarded by some grand guards, Mordek could not help but think to himself what an easy job this was.

Usually there was a lock to pick, security to evade, maybe even a guard to kill should one stand in his way.

But this temple is empty.

Surely there is nothing left here to steal and that man from the Hammers lied to him?

If so, he would find him and punish him for sending Mordek all the way to this vast, empty wasteland.

Mordek didn't usually take pleasure in killing, but this time there would be good reason to.

It was an odd job, though. Why hire him to steal something unguarded? what was the play here?

"After all, if a treasure is left all this time untouched, maybe that was a sign it should stay that way."

Mordek banished the thought out of his mind.

There was a job to do.

He steps gingerly inside the entrance, eagerly awaiting a trap he could spring and avoid.

No such luck.

Whoever built this temple really wasn't worried about thieves.

The entrance hall must have been once quite impressive, as it boasted a high ceiling, and many crumbling piles stood where columns decorated the space.

Stepping over some granite rubble, Mordek spots it - the entrance to the actual space the man described.

A large archway carved into the stone, inscribed with odd complicated runes lead to another smaller space.

And there it was.

Mordek had never seen anything so beautiful and ominous.

A dagger, long and sharp, it's hilt covered with the same runes on the archway.

It's blade shone with a curious red light.

It beckoned to him, half invitation half command.

Mordek stepped towards it with caution.

Carefully examining the blade, he inched his hand towards the hilt.

The closer his hand came to the hilt the stronger that strange pull in his mind that seemed to shout 'DEATH! FIRE! DESTRUCTION! BURN IT ALL!'.

Mordek grasps the hilt.

A searing, blinding pain grips him and for a moment he is no longer in the temple, no longer in the desert, no longer in Rumpfort.

He sees her then. A Tiefling woman laying on her knees, crying red tears, surrounded by ashes. Flames. Destruction. Suffering.

When Mordek awakes, he is lying on the temple floor.

In his hands, the blade seems to have sprung black tendrils up his arm.

He tries to throw it from him, but it will not stray from his palm.

Then she speaks.

  

## Ancient Power

Mordek was in distress.

This blade would not leave his hand, and the woman in it would **not** stop talking to him.

Was this some sort of curse?

At the back of Mordek's mind, he knew it wasn't.

As unpleasant as the vision in the temple was, and as annoying a this dagger is, he felt more powerful than ever when he held it.

What could he do with it anyway?

The question of the woman in the vision and the dagger haunted him.

Who is she? what does she want from him?

Did Thia know? She had to have known. This cannot just be a mistake. Something is going on.

Mordek's mind was mess of questions, writhing like bees in his mind as he stepped out of the temple into the now cool desert night.

"What now? business as usual? I think not.

Nobody swindles Mordek Brighthorn and gets away with it this easily."

Finding, capturing and maybe killing Thia would satisfy all his cravings at once - revenge, answers, and maybe a solution to this predicament.

He had a sneaking suspicion that's exactly to Thia's plans, but what other option did he have?

His first stop was Alvyn.

He needed his connections to find Thia, and maybe get some more information about this cursed blade.

After a while of walking back towards the port, the dunes shone brightly in the moonlight as the port was coming into his view.

On a dune to his left, a spec of movement caught his eye.

he spotted them just as they spotted him.

Two highway robbers out to prowl in the night.

And Mordek was their prey.

After everything that happened today, Mordek relished the opportunity to unleash his rage on some thugs.

He drew in his left hand the long blade he used regularly, and he ran at them.

You'd think growing up on the streets and being part of the Thieves Guild would teach Mordek a thing or two about swinging a dagger.

But this time he felt outclassed almost instantly.

Their blades clashed in a whirlwind of sparks, filling the night with strange lights as iron, steel, and the strange dagger's red metal clashed and scraped each other.

With each ***clang*** of the blades Mordek felt more and more that he was losing his balance, and would soon slip in his defense to catch one of the strangers blade in his side.

He regretted not running.

Just as his prophecy was coming true, and the blade of one of the strangers slipped passed his, he drew a final breath of despair.

But instead of pain in his side, he felt an explosion of red light erupt from the strange red blade.

The man was dead, his friend already running into the night.

This is going to be intersting.
