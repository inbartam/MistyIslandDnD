**Ruling Family:** The Emberhearts (Tiefling Noble House)  
**Domain:** Fire Magic, Criminal Influence

**History:**  
The **Emberhold Barony** was a small, isolated dominion on the southern edge of Rumpfort, a forsaken island known for housing criminals, exiles, and those deemed unworthy by the mainland. The ruling family, the **Emberhearts**, were a line of Tieflings who had long controlled the region, their power rooted in ancient fire magic. It is said that the Emberhearts' fiery abilities were not learned but inherited—granted to them by one of the ancient **Fire Titans** who once roamed the world in primordial times. According to legend, the first Emberheart, a renegade Tiefling from the mainland, made a pact with a dormant Fire Titan beneath the island, awakening a fragment of its power. In exchange, the Titan infused the family’s bloodline with fire magic, branding them with a fiery mark that passed from generation to generation.

The Emberhearts ruled over a small but powerful barony, using their fire magic to maintain control over the dangerous inhabitants of Rumpfort. The locals both feared and respected the Emberhearts, for their fiery powers were unmatched, and they were known to enforce their rule with burning wrath. However, their ties to fire magic made them volatile, prone to violent outbursts and deep corruption. The Emberhearts built Emberhold Keep, a grand fortress, symbolizing their dominance over both the land and fire itself.
