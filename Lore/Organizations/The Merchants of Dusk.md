The Dusk is a powerful, semi-legal organization on [[../Places/Islands#**Asentra**|The Anchor]]. The guild operates both as an influential trade organization and network of covert operations. Their influence varies from organizing shipments of goods and controlling tariffs to engaging in smuggling and protection rackets. The Merchants of Dusk walk a thin line between legitimacy and crime. Their influence stretches from the Upper City's council to the Lower City's darkest alleys.


### Structure
The guild is composed of several interconnected branches, each overseeing different aspects of their activities, from political influence to illicit dealings. At the top is the **Guildmaster**, who serves as the leader and final decision-maker, representing the guild's interests in both legitimate commerce and criminal enterprise.
