The Dusk is a powerful, semi-legal organization on [[../Places/Islands#**Asentra**|The Anchor]]. The guild operates both as an influential trade organization and network of covert operations. Their influence varies from organizing shipments of goods and controlling tariffs to engaging in smuggling and protection rackets. The Merchants of Dusk walk a thin line between legitimacy and crime. Their influence stretches from the Upper City's council to the Lower City's darkest alleys.
