In the beginning, [[The Titans]] shaped the world from the chaos of eternity, molding the seas, mountains and the skies into their vision of perfection, silent, lifeless, prefect balance. They were the creators, the shapers of the very land and sea. [The Titans](The%20Titans.md) longed for a world where nothing dared disturb the natural order they had imposed. [Gravitas](The%20Titans.md#gravitas---king-of-the-titans) the mighty King of the Titans, stood at the helm, demanding all things bow beneath the weight of his dominion. To the Titans, a world free from life, untouched by change, was the only true order.

The life that Jeros had envisioned, the life the gods had granted mortals, began to break the chains of the Titans’ dominion.
