In the beginning, there was chaos, and time had yet to begin. And a spirit moved through the vastness of the void, a spirit not bound by mortal realms. Time was not its dominion, [[The Gods#Eros|Eros]] was its name.


And [[The Gods#Eros|Eros]], in the stillness of eternity, dreamed. First, it dreamed of light and darkness, and behold, light and darkness came to be. And [[The Gods#Eros|Eros]] saw the light, and the darkness, and it was good.

Then, [[The Gods#Eros|Eros]] dreamed of stardust, and lo, the heavens were filled with it. The stars, in their multitude, illuminated the firmament, and their light shone across the endless sky.

And the spirit spoke, saying, "I am not alone." And it created another spirit, and called it [[The Gods#Ikur|Ikur]]. And Ikur spoke unto Eros, saying, "Let us create a world in thy image." 

And Eros heard the voice of [[The Gods#Ikur|Ikur]] and did as he had spoken. And Eros created more spirits, calling them [[The Titans|Titans]], and to each, Eros gave great power.

And Eros spoke unto the Titans, saying, "Go forth and build the earth, and shape it according to my will."

Thus, the Titans departed, and the earth was formed. And so began the First Age.
