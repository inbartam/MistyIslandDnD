Xalara was once a Tiefling, born into the powerful family, who ruled over a small barony, Emberhearts controlled fire magic, a gift passed down through generations within. **Obsidian Forge**, a deep and mysterious pit beneath their fortress. It was from this forge that the Emberhearts drew their power.

Xalara was raised in the richness of **Emberhold Keep**, the seat of her family’s power. Betrothed to a cruel and ambitious warlord, Xalara’s future seemed set in stone—she was to marry and further solidify her family’s influence over Rumpfort. However, Xalara’s heart was elsewhere. She had fallen in love with a commoner.

When the warlord discovered their affair, his jealousy and rage knew no bounds. He sentenced Xalara and her lover to a horrific fate—death in the **Obsidian Forge**. They were thrown into the forge, where they were consumed by flames. But something ancient stirred within the fire.

As Xalara and her lover burned,, transforming her into something far more powerful and dangerous than she had ever been, her spirit was reborn in flame. Xalara, now the living embodiment of fire and destruction, emerged from the forge as **The Flame Bringer**. Her fury was unrelenting, and in her rage, she reduced the town to ash, destroying everything in her path.

For centuries, Xalara ruled as a goddess of flame, burning cities, fields, and forests, believing that only through destruction could the world be purified and reborn anew.

However, fearing her wrath, a secret order of warriors and priests rose against her. They stole **The Ashen Heart**, where her flames could not reach.
