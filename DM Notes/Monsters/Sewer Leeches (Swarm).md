### **Traits**

1. **Swarm Mechanics**:
    
    - The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Small leech. The swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
2. **Blood Drain**:
    
    - If the swarm starts its turn in the same space as a creature, the creature takes **4 (1d8)** piercing damage and must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or take an additional **4 (1d8)** necrotic damage as blood is drained.
3. **Amphibious**:
    
    - The leeches can breathe both air and water.
