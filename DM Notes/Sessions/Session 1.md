	* You know where you need to go, into the depths of the lower spires of the anchor, away from the prying eyes. Your destination is the guild hall, hidden deep in the heart of the lower city. 
	* As you navigate through the bustling streets, you slip down a narrow alley, not wide enough for a cart. The entrance is well hidden. A disguised door lay behind a old, word down building. 
	* The hall is dimly lit, smell of smoke and candle wax lingering in the air. Inside you can see some figures sits over a circular table. You are able to recognize one of them, you see a bearded gnome with a Capitan hat.
	* You wait some minutes and they all standup, looks like the meeting is over. (They talked about zone of control and ships coming).
	* Go into his room, *"Been waiting for you,"*, handing you a folded note. *"We've got a big and important job"*. On the note you see those words ***[[Elion Thorne]], Wedding, The Golden Quarter***.

* **Ruth**
* **Natti** - 
	* DC 10 CON save - vomit from the waves.
	* You don't like it, the tilting of the waves, back and fort, clinking at the side of the ship. You don't like it, being in middle of the sea, only blue across the horizon, you don't like it. But, this is you4r first journey outside your utopic village, a place of creation, a place of craft, a place of god.  
	* You look at the **gift**, the creation of your father, a master crafter. It's a work of art, delicate, intricate and valuable. You ask yourself, why he ask me to deliver it, and not doing like always. 
	* The ship sways beneath you, and a quiet unease settles in your stomach, mixing with the nerves. The sound of sailors calling orders and the occasional creak of wood pulls you from your thoughts.
	* DC 15 Perception check - 
		* 10 see tifling
		* 15 cultists
	* As the ship rocks with the motion of the waves, your heart skips a beat when you hear a faint, almost imperceptible **crack**. Your breath catches. You kneel quickly, pulling back the cloth around the gift, revealing a **small crack** running along its surface. It's minor, but the weight of the task you’ve been given makes it feel enormous. You quickly cover it again, hoping it’s nothing serious.
	* The ship docks with a gentle thud, the city of **Anchor** rising before you like a chaotic labyrinth of stone, noise, and life. The smell of fish, smoke, and spices hits you, overwhelming your senses. Dockworkers rush past, loading and unloading crates, merchants shout from nearby stalls, and sailors laugh as they disembark.
	* You are navigation to the address you got
	*
