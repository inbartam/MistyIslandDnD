## All Ways Leads to the Anchor

* **Mordek** - 
	* **WAKEUP***, **WAKEUP, NOW***, you an deep voice inside your head, you can see the words in your imagination. 
	* You wakeup by a scream "Last stop, everyone, debark", a breeze of salty air combine with fish's smell fill your lungs. You standup and lock over the edge of the ship. You see a busy docks, blend in an organize chaos, moving dockworkers offloading crates upon crates, you can hear the merchants calls from the nearest bazaar. 
		* DC 10, 15 perception check - see some footpad watching the dockworkers | see one go into a warehouse.
	* You know where you need to go, into the depths of the lower spires of the anchor, away from the prying eyes. Your destination is the guild hall, hidden deep in the heart of the lower city. 
	* As you navigate through the bustling streets, you slip down a narrow alley, not wide enough for a cart. The entrance is well hidden. A disguised door lay behind a old, word down building. 
	* The hall is dimly lit, smell of smoke and candle wax lingering in the air. Inside you can see some figures sits over a circular table. You are able to recognize one of them, you see a bearded gnome with a Capitan hat.
	* You wait some minutes and they all standup, looks like the meeting is over. (They talked about zone of control and ships coming).
	* Go into his room, *"Been waiting for you,"*, handing you a folded note. *We've got a big and important job*
* **Lori**
* **Ruth**
