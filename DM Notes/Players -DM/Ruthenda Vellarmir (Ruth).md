## Early Life (Up to Age 12)
- **Heritage**: Ruth is an Aasimar, likely descended from the goddess [[../../Lore/The Gods#***Arthea - The Deceiver* **|]]. Born into a warrior tribe in northeast Crescenta, she was expected to become a fierce warrior, but instead showed a compassionate nature, often rescuing injured birds.
- **Tragedy and Loss**: Her parents died in a tribal battle, leaving her orphaned. For two years, she followed her tribe through endless battles until she decided to leave, feeling disconnected from the cycle of war.

## Wandering and Religious Awakening (Ages 12-35)
- **Years on the Road**: Ruth spent two years traveling across Crescenta, learning about different races and cultures. She eventually arrived in **Sabalon**, a city known for its diverse religions.
- **Encounter with Gozan**: In Sabalon, she met **Gozan**, a follower of *Valinor*, god of protection and sacrifice. Inspired by his selflessness, Ruth joined Gozan’s order and dedicated herself to helping those in need.
- **Life in Sabalon**: For 20 years, Ruth lived humbly, learning healing and first aid while serving Valinor. She joined missionary expeditions, constantly questioning if her actions truly made a difference, especially when faced with suffering orphans.

## The Missionary Years (Ages 35-50)
- **Commitment to Valinor**: Wanting to do more, Ruth set out as an independent missionary in western Crescenta, strengthening her skills and spreading Valinor’s teachings of peace and protection.
- **Return to Her Tribe**: She revisited her tribe but was met with suspicion and rejection due to her youthful appearance and her faith. Ruth severed ties with them, choosing to dedicate herself fully to her mission.
- **Founding the Orphanage**: Troubled by the plight of orphans, Ruth established an orphanage near the ice plains in Crescenta, with the support of Gozan and others. It became a place of refuge and healing for those in need.

## The Orphanage Tragedy (Ages 50-70)
- **Success and Peace**: For 20 years, Ruth’s orphanage thrived, helping countless children recover. Known for peace and healing, it was respected by local tribes and travelers alike.
- **Attack and Destruction**: While Ruth and her companion Marselia were tending a garden, raiders attacked, killing Marselia and burning the orphanage to the ground, leaving Ruth as the sole survivor. She discovered traces of a strange white powder and noted the absence of three orphans: Gorka, Molen, and Urru.
- **Oath of Vengeance**: Ruth vowed to find the missing orphans and avenge the tragedy. She took a sample of the powder, hoping it might help identify the attackers.

## Current Quest and Pursuit of Magic (Ages 70-Start of Campaign)
- **Searching for the Orphans**: For a year, Ruth searched for Gorka, Molen, and Urru, uncovering clues that pointed to **Burugan**, a ruthless outlaw leader responsible for the orphanage attack.
- **Seeking Power**: Losing faith in Valinor, Ruth turned to magic, stealing a sacred artifact to aid her quest. After being denied entry to White Tower’s magic academy, she traveled to the Anchor, Crescenta’s center of commerce, seeking resources for her search.
- **A New Path**: Now driven by vengeance and hope, Ruth arrives in the Anchor to gather information, refine her magical abilities, and uncover the truth behind the tragedy that haunts her.
