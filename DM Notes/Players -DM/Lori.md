**The Rise: The Phoenix Guard and Moments of Valor**
For 25 years, the character served loyally in [[../../Lore/Organizations/The Phoenix Guard|The Phoenix Guard]]. His service was marked by several significant moments that both defined him and slowly chipped away at his steadfast loyalty to the Emperor.

One night, while on watch over the Emperor’s chambers, the character experienced an otherworldly vision, a **dark phoenix**, its wings wreathed in flames, symbolizing destruction and the empire's downfall. This vision was the first of many that began to haunt him, leading him down a dark path.

It was **Umbros**, the **Titan of Darkness and Shadow**, who preyed on the character’s growing doubts and fears. Umbros sought to destabilize the empire and weaken the influence of the **Old Gods**, and he saw in the character a perfect tool for his plans.

Through subsequent visions, **Umbros** showed him scenes of a future filled with horror:

- **Dwarven and Elven Emissaries Before the Emperor**: In the visions, the character saw emissaries from the dwarves and elves pleading with the Emperor not to take a certain action—something that would lead to all-out war. The Emperor's response was either to kill them or dismiss them, showing a disregard for peace that ultimately triggered a dark chain of events.
    
- **The Invasion of The Belt of Men**: The character saw dwarven and elven forces invade the **Belt of Men**, committing atrocities against the human population. These visions were filled with scenes of bloodshed, looting, and destruction, filling the character with a sense of dread and urgency.
    
- **A Great War**: The vision showed a brutal war that consumed Etheria—famine spread, the land was scorched, and countless people died. The capital, **Marstal**, was set ablaze, and the character saw dwarves and elves overrunning the empire, displacing the humans.
    
- **The Decree**: Finally, **Umbros** gave the character a command. The only way to prevent this future was to **"stop the person who set it all in motion"**. Convinced that this person was the Emperor, the character saw only one path forward: assassination.
