**The Rise: The Phoenix Guard and Moments of Valor**
For 25 years, the character served loyally in [[../../Lore/Organizations/The Phoenix Guard|The Phoenix Guard]]. His service was marked by several significant moments that both defined him and slowly chipped away at his steadfast loyalty to the Emperor.

One night, while on watch over the Emperor’s chambers, the character experienced an otherworldly vision, a **dark phoenix**, its wings wreathed in flames, symbolizing destruction and the empire's downfall. This vision was the first of many that began to haunt him, leading him down a dark path.

It was **Umbros**, the **Titan of Darkness and Shadow**, who preyed on the character’s growing doubts and fears. Umbros sought to destabilize the empire and weaken the influence of the **Old Gods**, and he saw in the character a perfect tool for his plans.

Through subsequent visions, **Umbros** showed him scenes of a future filled with horror:

- **Dwarven and Elven Emissaries Before the Emperor**: In the visions, the character saw emissaries from the dwarves and elves pleading with the Emperor not to take a certain action—something that would lead to all-out war. The Emperor's response was either to kill them or dismiss them, showing a disregard for peace that ultimately triggered a dark chain of events.
    
- **The Invasion of The Belt of Men**: The character saw dwarven and elven forces invade the **Belt of Men**, committing atrocities against the human population. These visions were filled with scenes of bloodshed, looting, and destruction, filling the character with a sense of dread and urgency.
    
- **A Great War**: The vision showed a brutal war that consumed Etheria—famine spread, the land was scorched, and countless people died. The capital, **Marstal**, was set ablaze, and the character saw dwarves and elves overrunning the empire, displacing the humans.
    
- **The Decree**: Finally, **Umbros** gave the character a command. The only way to prevent this future was to **"stop the person who set it all in motion"**. Convinced that this person was the Emperor, the character saw only one path forward: assassination.
- 
**"It began on a night like any other, as you stood on watch outside the Emperor’s chambers. But something was different—something tugged at you, a whisper from deep within your soul, urging you to go to a place that none dare visit."**

**"The forbidden lake lay beyond the boundaries of Marstal, shrouded in mist and legend. You had heard the stories—of ancient power, of secrets buried in its depths, and of those who entered, never to return. Yet you felt a compulsion, a pull that you could not resist. So, under the cover of darkness, you ventured there, alone."**

**"The waters shimmered with an eerie, almost ethereal glow, and as you stepped in, a chill ran down your spine. The surface rippled, and then... you saw it."**

**"A dark phoenix rose from the depths of your vision, its wings engulfed in shadows and flames. It loomed above a burning empire, a harbinger of ruin. You could feel its heat, the oppressive weight of impending catastrophe. The vision shifted, and you found yourself standing in the Emperor’s grand hall, watching as emissaries from the dwarves and elves pleaded with him. Their faces were etched with desperation, their voices trembling as they begged the Emperor not to take a certain course of action—something they warned would lead to war."**

**"But in the vision, the Emperor dismissed them with cold arrogance. His face was hard, unyielding, and in that moment, you saw the seeds of disaster being sown. Perhaps he ordered their execution, or perhaps he simply had them thrown out. Either way, their warnings went unheeded, and the path to chaos was set."**

**"The vision shifted again, and now you saw the **Belt of Men** under attack. Elven and dwarven forces poured into the land, sweeping through villages and towns like a relentless storm. You heard the screams of innocents, saw flames consuming homes, and witnessed the unspeakable atrocities committed by those who had once sought peace. The vision filled you with a terrible dread—this was a future that could not be allowed to come to pass."**

**"And then... the Great War. Famine spread across the lands, the earth scorched, and the sky dark with smoke. You saw the capital, **Marstal**, in flames, the once-proud city now reduced to rubble and ash. Countless bodies lay scattered across the fields and streets, victims of an unrelenting war that had consumed all of Etheria. Dwarves and elves marched through the ruins, driving humans from their homes, their victory complete."**

**"And then, through the smoke and the flames, a voice spoke. It was calm, almost gentle, and you recognized it as **Yarko**—the deity of hope and salvation, the one you had believed in all your life. The voice whispered in your mind, 'This fate is inevitable unless you stop the one who sets it all in motion.' You could feel the weight of that command, the terrible responsibility it placed upon you. And then the vision ended, leaving you with a single, terrible conclusion—'The Emperor must be stopped.' "**

**"You emerged from the forbidden lake, drenched, shaken, and filled with a conviction unlike anything you had ever felt before. The future was clear—the empire was on the brink of disaster, and only you could prevent it. The Emperor, the very man you had sworn to protect, was the cause of all that would destroy Etheria. To save the empire, you would have to betray it."**


As the blade struck, the Emperor, in shock, turned slightly and locked eyes with the character. With a faint, strained voice, he whispered, "**Why? You were like a son to me...**" before his strength failed, and he collapsed. The words echoed in the character's mind, filling him with a momentary pang of doubt and guilt as he completed the assassination.
After assassinating the Emperor, the character escaped through the hidden passages of the palace, using his intimate knowledge of the palace's layout and avoiding the main guard routes. Under the cover of night, he reached a hidden dock used for secret imperial missions. There, he managed to bribe or coerce the crew of a small vessel to take him across the waters to **Asentra (The Anchor)**. The journey was dangerous, as he was aware that imperial forces would be searching for him, but he stayed hidden below deck until they reached the safety of the bustling port of Asentra, where he could blend in and vanish.

#### **3. The Forbidden Lake and the Visions**

One fateful night, a powerful compulsion drove him to the **forbidden lake**—a place said to be steeped in ancient power, where few dared to venture. The waters shimmered with an unnatural glow, and as he stepped into the lake, he felt an overwhelming presence.

It was there that he experienced the first vision—a **dark phoenix**, wings aflame, rising above a burning empire. The vision shifted, and he believed it was **Yarko**, a benevolent deity, showing him a future that needed to be prevented. Over the following nights, the visions grew more vivid and terrifying:

1. **The Emissaries Before the Emperor**: He saw dwarven and elven emissaries pleading with the Emperor to abandon a certain course of action that would lead to war. The Emperor’s cold dismissal, or perhaps even execution of the emissaries, set a dark future in motion.

4. **The Warning**: Finally, the voice spoke, and he believed it to be **Yarko**. “This fate is inevitable unless you stop the one who sets it all in motion.” The message was clear: **The Emperor must be stopped**.
    

#### **4. The Assassination of the Emperor**

Driven by the belief that he was acting to save Etheria, the character plotted the Emperor’s assassination. He chose a night when many guards were distracted by a festival in Marstal, allowing him to move through the palace unnoticed. He entered the Emperor’s private chambers, where the Emperor stood alone, gazing out the window.

Using a ceremonial dagger—an emblem of his loyalty—the character approached silently and stabbed the Emperor in the back. In his final moments, the Emperor managed to turn, locking eyes with his trusted protector. With his last breath, he whispered, **“Why? You were like a son to me...”** The weight of those words would haunt the character forever.

#### **5. The Escape to Asentra**

Realizing the gravity of his actions and the betrayal he had committed, the character fled Marstal. He used hidden passages within the palace to evade detection, slipping away into the night. He made his way to a secret dock used for covert imperial operations and managed to secure passage on a ship bound for **The Anchor (Asentra)**. The journey was perilous, but he stayed hidden, knowing that the Phoenix Guard would be hunting him.

Upon arriving in Asentra, he disappeared into the crowded streets, hiding from the empire he had once served.

#### **6. The Shattered Oath: A Cult of False Hope**

In Asentra, he encountered a secretive group known as **The Shattered Oath**—a cult that opposed the gods, preaching freedom from their influence. Their teachings resonated with him deeply, as he now harbored a deep hatred for the gods, believing that they had deceived him and led him to commit a grievous sin. What he did not realize was that this cult secretly served **Umbros**, the **Titan of Darkness and Shadow**, who had orchestrated the visions all along.

Desperate for redemption and a new purpose, the character joined the cult. He became a paladin, swearing an oath against the gods, believing in the cause of freeing mortals from divine manipulation. He fought for the cult, thinking he was bringing justice to those who had been wronged by the gods.

#### **7. The Memory Loss and a New Life as a Simple Guard**

At some point during his time with the cult, a mysterious event occurred—one that wiped his memory entirely. He lost all recollection of the assassination, the visions, and his time with the cult. With no memory of his past, he found himself adrift, eventually taking up work as a simple guard in Asentra, unaware of the powers he once wielded or the role he had played in the fate of the empire.

The cult, knowing his potential and the power he held, allowed him to live, watching from the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to use him once more. For now, he lives a quiet life, guarding warehouses and marketplaces, unaware of the dark past that lies buried within his mind.

#### **8. Present Day: A Man Lost Between Shadows and Light**

He is now a man without a past, working as an ordinary guard in the streets of Asentra. The people around him see only a stern, quiet guard, unaware of the history that lies behind his tired eyes. The cult still watches him, waiting for the right time to reveal his true nature, while **Umbros** remains in the shadows, knowing that his pawn may yet serve his purposes again.

Somewhere within him lies the potential of a paladin, the fierce loyalty of a Phoenix Guard, and the haunting memory of a betrayal that changed the course of Etheria. One day, those memories may resurface, and he will have to face the truth of what he did, and perhaps find a way to finally make amends.
