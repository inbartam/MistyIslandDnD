Lori is the son of the Head Phenix Guard,[[../NPCS/Don - Former head of the Phoenixs| Don DeShield]]. 
The DeShield and the Highrulers were friends, Don helped [[../../Lore/Cassidian Dynasty#Andurii the second|Andurii]] choose his wife, the queen Rose, and in turn the king himself was the one who married Don and Lori's mother, Luci.
Luci was a simple villager, but a beautiful one. In one of the king's errands, Don replenished in the village of <VILLAGE>, south west of the capital [[../../Lore/Places/Marstell - Capital of Etheria|Marstell]].

Luci was intelligent, smart and despite her common background, she was the perfect companion to Don. she bear 3 children.
Yon, the elder son was too in the honor guard but was killed in action while serving in the fight of <FIGHT>.  Lori all his life inspired by his brother, follow suit and served as well in legacy the Phenix guard. 

Lori is whole life trained with various weapons with his dad - spears, swords and shields.
Lori's best friend was the prince [[../../Lore/Cassidian Dynasty#Anduran the first|Anduran]], the next in line after the king <KING>.
Anduran was Lori's sparing match, his lifelong friend and a true companion.

Don died of an mysterious heart attack in his sleep.

## השירות הצבאי
Lori served his whole life under the Highrulers. He rose to the personal guard position and went to all of the political visits. He met all of the royalties in the [[../../Lore/Places/Etheria - The Crown of the Human Empire|Etheria]] in his visits.

## Relations with the King
The Highrulers were like a family for Lori. The king Andurii was like a second father. Anduran was his brother. In the last three years before the accident, there was a mental decline in Anduii's health. somedays he was as strong as ever. but some days, usually in the days global decisions were made, he did the worst that's possible. He passed a law to expel all the Elves from the city, destroying the political relation with the Highelves. Hanged innocent dwarves for alleged crimes. 
Lori couldn't see his county decline against his own eyes. 

## Relations with the prince
When speaking with Anduran about his father health, the conversation ended in a fight. The swords almost were drawn. Anduran love his father, and his father couldn't exist without being a king. he still believed Andurii did the best for the kingdom, although he did agree some atrocities were made.

## The First vision
When sent the political visit along with Anduran, he passed nearby the <GOD OF TREE>.
The <GOD> saw him multiple visions.
First, some crazy shit that happened in the city. He showed him a dove on fire passing above the city of <CITY>, then diving straight to the ground, and then 
a lighting in clear skies hitting the corpus of the dove.|

The second vision
The king Andurii dictates to expel all the elves and dwaves, and by night all those who remain will be decapitated.
The elf representive repent before the king, asking him not to do so. 

the third vision
Thousands of dwaves raid, steal, kill, rape and destory northen villages.

The Forth vision - the doomsday
Post-apocalypses castle. all of the land outside the kingdom is burning. the defences fell. corpuses everywhere. 

The Fifth Vision - the resolve.
"YOU MUST STOP THIS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE"
a vision of the consule happening in the Spring.

Lori thinks the visions are horrific but not yet convinced. 
but in the same evening a burning dove flew right next to him and a lighting struck down the dove.

## Killing the king
During the next few months later, Andurii acted weird. increased taxes, expelling the Drews, mobile more soldiers, cutting down certain trees.
Lori asked secretly from the high mage to see if he was possessed but the results came back negative.
and just like the vision, he expelled the Elves and the Dwarves alike, destroying half of <KINGDOM> exports.

In the next month, the brigading of the northen villages accrued.
It was horrific. thousands of displaced citizens. missing limbs. Daughters are pregnant. children without hands.
The Third vision occurred.

Lori knew what is going to happen. the next vision predicts the doom of <KINGDOM>. He must stop it. the price is too great. his home, his family, his profession. but more than it, he loves more his homeland.
He can't let so many people to die.

He waited when Andurii went to sleep, ordered his guards to abandon their post, and did the deed.
He made the arrangements beforehand, putting his possessions and family in a boat leaving for <PLACE>

Missioner
In the far land of <PLACE>, He did some odd jobs to support his family.
Lori helped in the [[../../Lore/Organizations/Guild of Nothing|Guild of Nothing]]. In a journey to <PLACE> he talked to the priest [[../NPCS/Udi - priest of the guild|Udi]] and describe his visions.
The priest said while visions can be real, most of the time they are used for manipulation and no visions are 100% accurate. and the lightning struck dove is entirely in god's power to arrange such thing.
"But what about the expulsion of the Elves and Dwarves? and the dwarves' brigade?"
The Udi explained: "You are right it's convincing"
"But the killing of the king can be the act that WILL make the the kingdom fall. vision and future is a risky business."
Sudden rage filled Lori. Was he a tool? a pawn? did he lost his home because some god's play and he won't even stop the kingdom's fall?
"Come join the Anti-Christ. We are trying to take down the gods."

The memory loss
At the end of journey, the god of <GOD> saw the large gathering of the Anti-Christ and while he usually didn't make amends at mortal lives, the opportunity was too good to be true. strike at all of them at once? at the end they preach against him ...

## His life
After the memory loss strike, he didn't know who he is, his profession, his family or even the name.
He expermintes at various arts, pottery, blacksmithing, magic but at the end his only talent was swords. so he continued what he did best, accompying
