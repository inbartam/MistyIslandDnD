### **Traits**

**Shadow Step**. As a bonus action, the Shadowfang Ravager can teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is in dim light or darkness.

**Necrotic Aura**. Creatures within 5 feet of the Ravager take 3 necrotic damage at the start of their turn (no save required).

**Blood Mark**. Once per encounter, the Ravager can mark one character within 30 feet. The marked character has disadvantage on Stealth checks, and the Ravager has advantage on attack rolls against it for 1 minute or until the Ravager takes damage from another creature.

### **Actions**

**Multiattack**. The Ravager makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

- **Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
    _Hit_: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
    
- **Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
    _Hit_: 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage.
    

**Necrotic Burst (1/Short Rest)**. The Ravager releases a wave of necrotic energy. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

### **Battle Strategy**

1. **Round 1**: The Ravager uses **Shadow Step** to close in on a player, preferably the one who seems weakest or the one marked by **Blood Mark**. It opens with a **Bite** and **Claw** attack to assert its threat and create tension.
    
2. **Round 2**: If multiple players are within range, it uses **Necrotic Burst** to weaken the group, creating an immediate need for healing or retreat.
    
3. **Mid-Battle**: The Ravagerâ€™s **Necrotic Aura** forces players to consider careful positioning. The monster tries to stay close to multiple players, forcing them to endure necrotic damage at the start of each turn.
    
4. **Low Health**: If reduced to 20 HP or below, the Ravager becomes desperate and uses **Shadow Step** to make hit-and-run attacks, retreating to dimly lit areas to dodge players.
