### **The Islands of Mist - Game World Summary**

The _Islands of Mist_ are a chain of seven main islands surrounded by smaller, less influential isles, each with its own complex geopolitical and cultural landscape. The islands are:

1. **Etheria**: The largest island, ruled by the Etherian Empire of humans. It is divided into four main regions, each with autonomy under the empire's control. Etheria is the center of power, but it faces internal struggles as different regions vie for influence.
    
2. **Isloff**: A rugged, mountainous island home to dwarves. It is rich in diamonds and devoid of agriculture, leading its people to build vast subterranean cities. The dwarves harbor deep hatred for humans, and Isloff is known for its raiders and powerful Viking-like culture.
    
3. **Asentra**: Known as "The Anchor," this island is a critical trade hub located in the center of the sea, connecting all islands. Its cultural diversity stems from its position as an essential stop for trade and travel. Control over Asentra is crucial to dominate the regional economy.
    
4. **The White City**: A small but politically significant island, home to the Supreme Court of Justice and the Magic Academy. It is the center of law and magic regulation in the Islands of Mist, directly connected to Crescenta via giant bridges. It is a key player in the power struggle among the islands.
    
5. **Crescenta**: Known as "The Support," Crescenta is home to the high elves, who also wield influence over the White City. Much of the island is uninhabitable due to chaotic magic. Crescenta is involved in a power struggle for control over the islands, with factions leveraging dangerous magic.
    
6. **Yarkon**: This island is inhabited by wood elves and half-orcs. Its name comes from its two-faced shape, and it is known for its giant forests and recent discovery of diamond mines. It remains a place of natural beauty but with growing economic importance due to its resources.
    
7. **Rumpfort**: The northeastern island, heated by volcanic activity. It consists of two types of deserts—an ice desert and a regular desert. It serves as an exile for criminals, outcasts, and evil creatures. It is a harsh land, but power can be gained here for those daring enough to seize it.
    

### **The Titans and Gods**

- **The Titans**: Primordial beings that created the world and ruled it in silence. The Titans' war against the Old Gods ended with their defeat and imprisonment in the moon by Eros, with Helena sacrificing herself to ensure their eternal slumber. Their influence remains, and fragments of their power are scattered across the islands.
    
- **The Old Gods**: Ancient beings who created the mortals and opposed the Titans' desire for a barren world. They now struggle for power and influence, each having their own pocket dimension. Worship of the Old Gods is widespread, with different cults across the islands.
    
- **The New Gods**: Mortals who ascended to godhood through power, cunning, or sacrifice. Their influence is growing, and they are in direct conflict with both the Old Gods and the remnants of the Titans. Worship of the New Gods often revolves around their particular virtues and mortal deeds.
