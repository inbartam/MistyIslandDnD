### Setting the Scene: The War Room in Isloff

---

The cold wind howls through the stone corridors of the **Frostclaw Raiders' Fortress**, perched high on a jagged cliff overlooking the stormy seas of **Isloff**, known for its inhospitable terrain and unforgiving weather. The fortress is carved directly into the rock, its halls lit by flickering torches that cast long, dancing shadows across the walls. Despite the biting chill in the air, the **War Room** is filled with heat—both from the crackling hearth and the simmering tension of the warriors gathered inside.

The **War Room** itself is a large circular chamber with a heavy wooden table in the center, upon which a **massive map of the Human Belt** is laid out, held in place by thick iron spikes. The table is scarred from years of battle planning, and the **walls are adorned with shields**, banners, and trophies from past raids—helmets of fallen enemies, swords rusted with age, and bones, reminders of the battles fought and won. Along the walls, **runestones** glow faintly with ancient magic, a gift from the dwarves of Nidavellir, providing a dull, eerie illumination.

### Description of the Raid Commander: Frostclaw Leader - **Skjorn the Ironhand**

At the head of the table stands **Skjorn the Ironhand**, leader of the **Frostclaw Raiders**, a Viking warlord feared for his ruthless tactics and unrelenting ambition. Skjorn is a massive figure, clad in **blackened iron armor**, forged with intricate designs resembling jagged ice. His armor is heavy, yet he moves with the fluidity of a predator, every step deliberate and full of menace.

His face is weathered, hardened by countless battles, with a thick, braided black beard streaked with silver, and pale blue eyes that gleam like ice. His left hand is a fearsome weapon in itself—a **prosthetic hand of cold iron**, forged by dwarven smiths, capable of crushing a man’s skull with ease. Legends say he lost his real hand battling a sea monster off the coast of Isloff, and now his iron hand has become a symbol of his unyielding nature.

Skjorn speaks in a **deep, gravelly voice**, his words carrying the weight of command. Though he is a man of few words, each one is chosen carefully, and his warriors listen with unwavering attention.

### The War Room Meeting

Skjorn’s iron hand slams down on the map, causing the heavy table to creak under the force.

"**Etheria lies ripe for the taking**," he growls, his voice low but carrying the power of a roaring storm. "Their villages grow fat, their lords lazy, and their gods... weak." He traces a jagged scar across the map, pointing at the **Human Belt** with a contemptuous sneer. "We will strike like a storm, fast and without mercy."

He looks up, scanning the faces of the raiding party assembled before him. Each warrior is handpicked, seasoned in battle, and loyal to the **Frostclaw banner**. Skjorn’s icy gaze fixes on the group.

"But this raid... it is not just for glory or gold. We have a mission." His iron hand curls into a fist. "The humans hide something in their vaults—**an artifact of great power**—something the **gods themselves** fear. It must be ours, for with it, we shall **command the storms** and bend the will of men."

He turns to his **second-in-command**, a scarred and cunning warrior named **Ragnar Blacktide**, and nods. Ragnar unfurls a scroll, revealing more detailed intelligence about the Human Belt, its defenses, and the target locations.

"Your job," Skjorn continues, "is to **retrieve the artifact** at any cost. Burn their villages, raze their temples, but **do not return without the prize**. And remember, **the gods are watching.**"

With that, Skjorn pounds his iron hand against his chest in a salute, the sound ringing like a hammer striking an anvil.

"**Frostclaws! Prepare to sail!**"


### The Sea Crossing

With the plans set, the raiding party boards their ships, Viking longships with **serpentine prows** that cut through the icy waves like knives. The journey across the **Frigid Sea** is perilous, with **dark clouds looming** on the horizon. But it’s not just the storm they must face. As they sail, they spot a **human warship**, a heavily armed vessel bristling with ballistae. The humans are patrolling the waters, prepared for raids. The players must decide:

- **Do they engage the warship head-on?**
- **Do they outmaneuver it using the treacherous tides and fog?**
- **Or do they attempt a covert passage in the storm’s cover?**

Further along, a **small human scout ship** appears, trying to slip away to warn the mainland. The raiders must act fast to prevent word of their raid from reaching **Etheria’s shores**.
